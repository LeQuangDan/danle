## Project
Wearable Haptic
As the technical lead for this project, Dr. Le is responsible for designing and prototyping a wearable haptic device for underwater teleoperation, starting from scratch. This includes both hardware and software development, with low-level control based on an ARM microcontroller integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System). The haptic device enables the operator to control an underwater robot's gripper with force feedback, allowing them to feel objects being touched underwater. The system employs admittance control to achieve this functionality.

## Lectures
