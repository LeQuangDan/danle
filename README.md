University of Ulsan, Korea
M.S and Ph.D. Candidate, 2016-July 2022
        ◦ Research topics:
+ Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning with soft actor-critic algorithm was applied in the end-to- end control. End-to-end control is the input sensor of robot directly transfer to torque output at actuator by reinforcement learning control without any conventional controller. I used soft actor-critic algorithm and inverse reinforcement learning to approach the end-to-end control.
+ Fault-Tolerant Control: Proposed a synchronization technique in fault-tolerant control for serial robot manipulators. By the ability to make the error at each joint simultaneously approach to zero of synchronization technique, robot manipulators can reduce the peaking phenomenon effect of faults. Unlike another researcher in fault-tolerant control only focus on controller issues such as chattering, slow convergence, the ability to deal with uncertainties and so on, my proposed controller tackles the picking phenomenon effect which is the specific problem of fault-tolerant control and the highest effect to the performance of robot manipulators. The proposed control has been verified on 3-DOF robot manipulator in simulation and real 3-DOF FARA-AT2 robot system.
+ Force Control: The force control was implemented on 3-DOF FARA-AT2 robot manipulator using 3-DOF force sensor at end-effector with hybrid force/position control and impedance control. In addition, the extended state observer was used to detect the contraction of human with robot during tracking trajectory. The force control has been developed with low level control.
+ Control a Parallel robot: The dynamic model of 3-DOF plane parallel robot manipulator was investigated to apply the model-based controller. Unlike the serial robot manipulator with open-loop mechanism, the parallel robot manipulator has a close-loop mechanism which has complex dynamic model. Several controllers were applied to show the advantage and disadvantage of parallel robot.
    • Attended project:
+ Fault-tolerant control: I implemented the fault-tolerant control algorithms by using Labview on AT2- SAMSUNG robot manipulator. To apply the low-level control on the commercial robot, the original controller of robot manipulator was replayed by NI PXI (Texas Instrument) computer with Labview in Window. The fault-tolerant control, dynamic model control and kinematic control was applied on robot manipulator based on Labview-FPGA.
+ Grinding mobile robot: Robot will follow the welding path on the cover of ship to check the quality of welding then grind it. I established the control library for robot on ROS, Rviz an Gazebo to tracking the welding path and visualization the real robot moving and the sensor.
+Metal printer with 5-axis: The metal printer was built from scratch by using the laser to print the metal. The printer will read G-code file then prints the metal with the online modification parameter of the printer. I implemented the controller for 5-axis metal printer by using Simulink Real-Time Desktop in MATLAB and C#.
